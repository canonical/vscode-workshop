# Welcome to Workshop VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesn’t yet need to load the plugin.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

* `workshop launch`, this project uses Workshop to run the entire development environment in a container.
* Connect to the workshop using VS Code Remote Development Extension.
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.


## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* `workshop connect ext/vscode-remote:desktop ext/system:desktop` if not connected.
* Run the "watch-tests" task (or `npm run watch-tests`) to compile the tests into the `out` folder. Keep it running while you work, or build once with `npm run compile-tests`.
* Run the tests with `npm test`.
  * This launches a headless VS Code instance and runs every file matching `out/test/**/*.test.js`.
  * The npm script already sets `XAUTHORITY=/tmp/.Xauthority` so it can reach the workshop's X server; no extra setup is required.
* See the test results in the integrated terminal.
* Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  * The test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.

## Go further

* Reduce the extension size and improve the startup time by [bundling your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension).
* [Publish your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) on the VS Code extension marketplace.
* Automate builds by setting up [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration).
